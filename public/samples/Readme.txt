This zip file contains a DXF file, which is an AutoCAD-compatible file. There are a couple of requirements you must
follow before it can be viewed properly.

Install fonts
-------------

Install the following font files in order to show text at the correct size and to view icons.
This can be done by double-clicking the font files and selecting "Install Font" (or similar text) when opened by the
system font management tool.

FontAwesome.ttf      - Main icon library
ShowhubIcons.ttf     - Additional icons

If double-clicking the font files doesn't do anything, make sure you have unzipped this package and are not just
viewing the compressed files (sometimes this is the default behavior in Windows). Right-clicking the zip file will
provide options to extract to a new folder.


Layers
------

The DXF file is split out into many layers to help make the content easier to filter and understand.

Each layer displays a different kind of object or property of an object.
i.e. Doors, walls and floors will be on separate layers, as will be regions with a height limit of 2m and regions with a
height limit of 4m.

Some properties for some layers are only visible in the layer name, such as height limits and stand types.
